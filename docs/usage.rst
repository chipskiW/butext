Here is an example of importing the proper libraries and functions:

.. code-block :: python

   spam = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Greg-Hallenbeck/HARP-210-NLP/main/datasets/SMSSpamCollection.tsv", sep="\t")
   spam['doc_id'] = range(len(spam)) #Need to tokenize per email, so add index column to data
   spam.head()

Output

.. code-block :: python

      class 	text	                                           doc_id
